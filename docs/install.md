# OS

Discomfort is expected to work on all major versions of Linux, macOS and Windows.

# ComfyUI

Due to ComfyUI not following a strict release versioning, it is hard to provide a compatibility matrix. We try to make sure that Discomfort works with the latest version from master but we cannot guarantee 100% compatibility at all times.
